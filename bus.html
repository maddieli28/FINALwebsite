            <p>Hong Kong's double-decker buses have been an iconic part of the city's public transport system since the mid-20th century, with their towering frames and vibrant colors becoming a signature of the urban landscape. These buses, operated by companies like Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) and Citybus, have transitioned from older diesel models to modern, low-floor and electric designs to align with sustainability goals. A notable event in this history occurred in 2024, when enthusiasts and residents gathered to bid farewell to Hong Kong’s last non-low-floor bus, the Volvo Olympian, marking the end of an era. The final journey turned into a city-wide celebration, with passengers reminiscing and honoring the legacy of a vehicle that once symbolized the evolution of Hong Kong's public transportation.

            <p>Hong Kong is actively transitioning to a zero-emission public transportation system, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. The government has set a target to introduce approximately 700 electric buses by the end of 2027. 

            </p>
            <p>The Kowloon Motor Bus Company (KMB) plans to upgrade its entire fleet to new energy buses by 2040. In line with this initiative, Alexander Dennis is introducing battery-electric vehicles to the city, including the Enviro100EV—a compact single-decker bus designed to seat up to 26 passengers and accommodate up to 45 passengers in total.
