            <p>Post-2047, Hong Kong's government may implement more aggressive land reclamation and development projects, as seen in other Chinese megacities. The focus could shift towards creating more integrated, high-density urban areas that optimize land use but also raise concerns about the gentrification of neighborhoods and the displacement of lower-income residents. This kind of urban planning could exacerbate the wealth gap if not managed with policies aimed at inclusivity.

            </p>
            <p>To address the severe housing shortage and the issue of cage homes—small, coffin-like spaces rented out to the city's poorest residents—new policies could prioritize the development of affordable housing units. However, the success of these initiatives will depend heavily on their execution and the extent to which they meet the needs of the lower and middle-income populations without succumbing to the pressures of commercial interests.

            </p>
            <p>Land use changes might also be geared towards better integration with the Greater Bay Area’s infrastructure, linking Hong Kong more closely with mainland China’s transport, economic, and technological frameworks. While this could lead to economic growth and more efficient city planning, there is a risk that local needs and contexts might be sidelined in favor of broader strategic goals, potentially neglecting the unique challenges faced by Hong Kong’s diverse population.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, the changes in property and land use policies in Hong Kong post-2047 will be a key factor in determining the future of the city’s urban environment. The challenge will be to harness these changes for progressive urban development while ensuring they do not deepen existing inequalities or compromise the cultural and social fabric of Hong Kong.
