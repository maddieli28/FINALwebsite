            <p>The MTR, renowned for its exceptional efficiency and reliability, often achieves a 99.9% on-time performance rate, a standard that is among the highest in the world for metro systems. 
            </p>
            <p>After 2047, with the potential full integration of Hong Kong under Chinese control, immigration and movement policies between Hong Kong and the mainland could undergo significant liberalization. This could facilitate a much easier flow of people for living, working, and traveling between the two regions. Such changes are likely to have profound effects on various aspects of life and infrastructure, including the transportation systems like the Mass Transit Railway (MTR).
            </p>
            <p>Maintaining this level of service could become challenging with the increased demand expected from daily cross-border commuters. To manage this, the MTR may need to undergo expansions and upgrades, including more frequent services and the construction of new lines to better connect with mainland transport networks. Operational integration might also extend to synchronized schedules and ticketing systems with mainland transit services, ensuring smoother transitions at key entry point stations like Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau. These stations might see the implementation of advanced security and immigration control technologies to efficiently handle the increased flow of passengers while maintaining high security standards. Adjustments in fare structures, operational regulations, and perhaps even the legal frameworks under which the MTR operates might be needed to accommodate these new policies and maintain efficient service amid rising demand.
